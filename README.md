# Enhancing Cyber Attack Detection in Grid-Connected PV Systems:A Topological Machine Learning Approach
Welcome to the repository!. This is an innovative topological deep learning model for Attack Detection in Grid-Connected PV Systems. This implementation uses IEEE 34, 123 and 8500 bus distribution test network dataset. The code is written in Python and utilizes PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric.


# Model Architecture



# Requirements
The code depends on the followings:
Pytorch 2.4.0, Pyflagser 0.4.7, networkx 3.2.1, sklearn 1.3.0, torch_geometric 2.4.0

   
The code is implemented in python 3.11.4. 





# Runing the  Experiments
To repeat the experiment, run the train_*.py file
